    "## Week 6 - Final Design\n",
    "This week’s project is all about logic. We need to understand how to set up a step-by-step process for logging users in and out. There are three main parts to this program, registering a user, logging a user in, and the main loop that will run the program. Knowing that the first two are tasks, we can make functions out of them and call them when necessary in the main loop. Let’s go ahead and lay out the logical process for this program:\n",
    "1.\tCheck to see if user is logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. If logged in, ask if they would like to log out/quit.\n",
    "   \n",
    "             i.\tEither quit or log out user and restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "        b. Else, ask if they would like to log in/register/quit.\n",
    "                \n",
    "             i. If log in, ask user for e-mail/password.\n",
    "\n",
    "                    1. If correct, log user in and restart.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "                    2. Else, display error and restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "            ii. If register, ask for e-mail/password/password2.\n",
    "                        \n",
    "                    1. If passwords match, save user and restart.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "                    2. Else, display error and restart.\n",
    " \n",
    "            iii. If quit, say thank you and exit program.\n",
